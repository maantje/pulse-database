Ensure you're running [the `pulse:check` command](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pulse#capturing-entries).

## Add to your dashboard

Integrate the card into your Pulse dashboard by [publish the vendor view](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pulse#dashboard-customization).
and then adding the following to the `dashboard.blade.php` file:

```html
<livewire:database cols='6' title="Active threads" :values="['Threads_connected', 'Threads_running']" :graphs="[
    'avg' => ['Threads_connected' => '#ffffff', 'Threads_running' => '#3c5dff'],
]" />

<livewire:database cols='6' title="Connections" :values="['Connections', 'Max_used_connections']" />

<livewire:database cols='full' title="Innodb" :values="['Innodb_buffer_pool_reads', 'Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests', 'Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total']" :graphs="[
    'avg' => ['Innodb_buffer_pool_reads' => '#ffffff', 'Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests' => '#3c5dff'],
]" />
```

And that's it! Enjoy enhanced visibility into your database status on your Pulse dashboard.
